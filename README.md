# portfolio
Welcome, Welcome!  

Despite working in software for years, I have allowed my contributions to be wholely done on private repos, invisible to the public and owned by others.

It is about time I actually put up my own portfolio.

This whole thing shall be public:
 - To face my fear of open creation, and the ensuing criticism
 - To force proper secret management
 - To pad my git commits /s

## Blog
TODO.  Wordpress.
If it's good enough for https://www.joelonsoftware.com/ it's good enough for me.
